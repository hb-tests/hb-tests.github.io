      <h3 class="services-mom-lead">This weekend is all about Mom and we can’t wait to celebrate her!</h3>
			<p class="services-sub text-center">Her ambition does push-ups while she sleeps, her creativity knows no bounds and her time management skills veer into supernatural territory.  She's a momprenuer and she deserves to be celebrated.  Nominate a mompreneur who dazzles you with her ability to fearlessly balance the chaos of running a business with the endless hustle of motherhood.</p>
      <p class="services-sub text-center">The HoneyBook team will review all nominations and select one inspiring mother whose positive influence, small business tenacity, passion for the community, and all around bravery set her apart. HoneyBook’s Mompreneur of the Year will be announced on Thursday, May 12th at 12pm Pacific. Don’t worry Dads, you know that we love you too…</p>
